            I'm a passionate full-stack web developer based in Nigeria, with a strong foundation in frontend and backend technologies and a growing portfolio of real-world products. I specialize in building modern, scalable applications using Django, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS—turning ideas into live, user-focused solutions. With a background in IT systems and networking, I bring a holistic view to development, ensuring my applications are not only beautifully crafted but also secure, maintainable, and production-ready. I’ve worked across different stacks and hosting environments—from Firebase and Render, to Dockerized deployments with Redis, PostgreSQL, and Django Channels.
